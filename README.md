# Periphery

Periphery is an interactive installation designed and built by Paul Kirby and Steven Krejcik for True/False film festival 2020.

This installation utilizes a large grid of 3"x3" pixels covered in PDLC smart film.

The smart film is controlled by a massive bank of relays, which are all controlled by an Intel RealSense depth camera.
